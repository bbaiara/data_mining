# Data Mining Repository

This repository contains implementations of various data mining algorithms organized into two main directories:

## Frequent Itemset Mining
- **Algorithms**: 
  - Apriori
  - FP-Growth
- **Purpose**: Identify frequently occurring itemsets in large datasets.

## Clustering Algorithms
- **Algorithms**:
  - KMeans (with KMeans++)
  - DBSCAN
- **Purpose**: Perform unsupervised clustering and grouping of data points based on similarity or density.
